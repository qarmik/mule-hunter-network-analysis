\# Investigative Assumptions — Mule Hunter



This document defines the investigative assumptions underlying Mule Hunter.

These assumptions reflect common patterns observed in organised fraud and mule networks within digital banking and fintech environments.



The tool is designed to support human investigators by making relationship-based risk visible.

It does not claim ground truth or automated decisioning.

\## Core Investigative Hypothesis



Organised fraud rarely operates through a single account.

Instead, it relies on multiple accounts that appear independent but are controlled by a shared actor or group.

The strongest signals of such common control are often infrastructural rather than transactional.

---



\# Assumption 1: Shared Devices Indicate Non-Independence



I multiple customer accounts consistently originate activity from the same device identifier,

those accounts are unlikely to represent independent actors.



Rationale:

\- Genuine customers rarely share physical devices over extended periods

\- Fraud rings deliberately reuse devices to manage multiple mule accounts

\- Device reuse often precedes transactional linkage



Limitations:

\- Shared devices may occur in cybercafés or family environments

\- This signal must be contextualised, not used in isolation



---



\## Assumption 2: Repeated IP Address Overlap Is a Weak but Useful Signal



IP address reuse across accounts is treated as a weak linkage signal.



Rationale:

\- IP addresses can be shared legitimately (offices, mobile carriers)

\- Persistent IP overlap combined with other signals increases confidence

\- IP data helps sequence activity temporally



Limitations:

\- NAT, VPNs, and mobile networks reduce reliability

\- IP overlap alone should never drive conclusions



---



\## Assumption 3: Organised Fraud Exhibits Network Structure



Fraud rings tend to form clusters rather than linear chains.



Observable patterns:

\- Groups of accounts densely connected through shared attributes

\- One or two highly central nodes coordinating activity

\- Peripheral nodes with limited independent behaviour



This assumption motivates the use of network graph analysis rather than rule evaluation.



---



\## Assumption 4: Centrality Can Indicate Control, Not Guilt



Nodes with high connectivity or centrality are treated as candidates for further review,

not as definitive organisers.



Rationale:

\- Controllers often manage credentials, devices, or infrastructure

\- Centrality reflects coordination, not intent



This distinction is critical for responsible investigative use.



---



\## Assumption 5: False Positives Are Preferable to Invisible Networks



The tool is designed to surface suspicious clusters for human review,

even at the cost of some false positives.



Rationale:

\- Invisible organised fraud is riskier than review overhead

\- Investigators are expected to apply judgement post-identification



This aligns with real-world AML and fraud investigation workflows.



---



\## Explicit Non-Goals



Mule Hunter does NOT attempt to:

\- Predict fraud likelihood at the individual account level

\- Replace transaction monitoring systems

\- Provide real-time detection

\- Assign legal or regulatory conclusions



---



\## Scale and Operational Limits



This prototype assumes:

\- Batch analysis on limited datasets

\- Use in investigative or exploratory contexts

\- Visual inspection of outputs



It is not optimised for production-scale deployment.



---



\## Investigator Responsibility



All outputs generated by Mule Hunter are investigative leads only.

Final determinations remain the responsibility of trained investigators

operating under applicable legal and regulatory frameworks.
