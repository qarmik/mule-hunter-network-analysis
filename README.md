Investigator-led network analysis tool to detect organized mule account rings using shared device, IP, and infrastructure fingerprints.



\# Mule Hunter — Network Analysis for Organised Fraud Detection



\## Problem This Solves

In fintech and digital banking, organised fraud frequently operates through multiple apparently unrelated accounts.

Individually, these accounts may pass KYC checks and remain below transaction thresholds.

Risk only becomes visible when accounts are analysed as a network.



Mule Hunter is an investigator-led tool that reconstructs hidden common control by linking accounts through shared device, IP, and infrastructure fingerprints.



\## Why This Matters in Fintech

Rule-based systems evaluate accounts in isolation.

Experienced investigators evaluate relationships.



This tool translates investigator intuition into a reproducible, auditable analytical workflow suitable for fraud and financial-crime teams.



\## What This Tool Does

\- Links accounts using shared technical attributes (device ID, IP address, phone, etc.)

\- Builds a network graph representing potential common control

\- Identifies clusters consistent with organised mule operations

\- Surfaces central nodes that may indicate controllers or organisers



\## What This Tool Does NOT Do

\- It does not make automated blocking decisions

\- It does not replace investigator judgement

\- It does not claim real-time or production-scale deployment



\## Intended Audience

\- Fraud investigators

\- Financial crime analysts

\- Fintech risk teams



\## Status

Baseline established. Investigative assumptions defined before any code is written.
